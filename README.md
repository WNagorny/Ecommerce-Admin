Welcome to the Responsive Admin Panel project with Shadcn UI! This versatile admin dashboard is designed to be your one-stop solution, serving as a Content Management System (CMS), Admin panel, and API hub. With a wide range of features, you can efficiently manage multiple vendors/stores, create and manage categories, products, filters, billboards, and much more.

## Key Features

- **Shadcn UI Integration:** We've integrated Shadcn UI for a sleek and modern admin interface.

- **Unified CMS:** Our admin dashboard seamlessly combines CMS, Admin, and API functionalities.

- **Product Management:** Handle your product catalog with ease. Create, update, and delete products at your convenience.

- **Powerful Search:** Easily search through categories, products, sizes, colors, and billboards with built-in pagination.
